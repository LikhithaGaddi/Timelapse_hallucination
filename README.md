# Data Driven Time Lapse Hallucination from a single image

This project aims at creating a Time Lapse Hallucination video of a given image using the database constructed from the various timelapse hallucination videos acquired over time. The internals of the project is basically two modules working together sequentially.

## Preprocessing the Data:
In this part we have extracted frames from the timelapse videos that we have accumulated and stored them in a separate folder.

## Module 1
In this module the image feature has been studied and image matching is carried of using the technique called the Bags of Visual Word.  

## Module 2

In this module the style transfer is taking place as explained in the paper titled "Color Transfer Between Images" by Reinhart et all. 

#### Steps to execute

* If the database is updated run

  ```
  python generate_csv.py
  python generate_frames.py

  ```
* To generate a video run

  ```

  python image_searcher.py -q ./Query_images/query1.jpg -r ./videos/

  ```
